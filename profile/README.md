# JuliaTDA: Topological Data Analysis in Julia

JuliaTDA is an organization that aims to reunite many packages related to Topological Data Analysis.

For clustering and graph-reducing algorithms, we have 
- [TDAmapper.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTDA/TDAmapper.jl): Mapper-like algorithms for clustering and graph-reducing high-dimensional data;
- ToMATo [to do]: the ToMATo clustering algorithm from [reference].

For persistent homology, there are 
- [Ripserer.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/Ripserer.jl): calculate the Vietoris-Rips filtration and homology, among other things;
- [PersistenceDiagrams.jl](https://github.com/mtsch/PersistenceDiagrams.jl): create persistence images from persistence diagrams.
